### Hi! I'm kayt!

- I'm a student and I make stuff sometimes! I usually work in TS and more specifically Svelte, but I'll occasionally work in Python!
- 🏳️‍⚧️ My pronouns are she/they
- 🔭 Right now I'm working on rewriting my [PluralKit editor](https://pk.kayt.dev) in Svelte because I got tired of working in Next
